# Summary & Insights

In this analysis, I explored how departure delays relate to arrival
delays for flights leaving NYC in 2013. First, I visualized the
distribution of each variable separately. Both `dep_delay` and
`arr_delay` are heavily skewed right, with most flights having small
delays or even early arrivals. A smaller number of flights experienced
long delays, which are clearly visible in the histogram tails.

In the scatter plot of departure delay vs arrival delay, we see a clear
positive relationship. This means flights that depart late often arrive
late as wellâ€”though not perfectly. The variation shows that some flights
may make up lost time, while others may face additional delays. I chose
histograms for univariate plots because they clearly show skewness and
density, and a scatter plot for the bivariate relationship to visualize
spread and correlation between the two variables.
