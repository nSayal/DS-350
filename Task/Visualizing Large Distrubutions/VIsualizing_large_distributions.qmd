# Summary & Insights

In this analysis, I explored how departure delays relate to arrival delays for flights leaving NYC in 2013. First, I visualized the distribution of each variable separately. Both `dep_delay` and `arr_delay` are heavily skewed right, with most flights having small delays or even early arrivals. A smaller number of flights experienced long delays, which are clearly visible in the histogram tails.

In the scatter plot of departure delay vs arrival delay, we see a clear positive relationship. This means flights that depart late often arrive late as wellâ€”though not perfectly. The variation shows that some flights may make up lost time, while others may face additional delays. I chose histograms for univariate plots because they clearly show skewness and density, and a scatter plot for the bivariate relationship to visualize spread and correlation between the two variables.
