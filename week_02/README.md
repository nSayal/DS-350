# Week 2 Notes
# Data Project Ideas and Feedback

Below are four potential data-driven questions for a project, along with examples, and a section for peer and teacher feedback.

## 1. How does sleep affect student grades and stress across majors?

**Why it's interesting:** Different majors may have different sleep patterns. This project can show how sleep might affect performance and well-being.

**Data sources:** Campus surveys or health datasets like the National College Health Assessment.

**Example article:** [CDC: Sleep Duration by Occupation](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6116a2.htm)

**Feedback:**
- Peer 1: Sounds relatable! Would love to know if engineering students sleep less.
- Peer 2: You could even add gender differences.
- Teacher: Check if you can access student health data at our campus.

## 2. What affects tipping in the U.S. — weather, day, or type of service?

**Why it's interesting:** Tipping is common, but people behave differently based on conditions.

**Data sources:** NYC Taxi and weather data.

**Example article:** [FiveThirtyEight - Tipping Patterns](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-restaurants-people-tip-best-and-worst/)

**Feedback:**
- Peer 1: Great! Especially if you add charts by day of week.
- Peer 2: How would you get restaurant tips?
- Teacher: You can start with public taxi tip data and weather overlays.

## 3. Do mental health Google searches change with unemployment or inflation?

**Why it's interesting:** It shows how economic stress might affect people's emotions.

**Data sources:** Google Trends, FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data).

**Example article:** [Our World in Data: Mental Health](https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health)

**Feedback:**
- Peer 1: I like this! Feels current and important.
- Peer 2: It might be hard to tell cause and effect.
- Teacher: Try starting with a few years of trend data and make graphs first.

## 4. How has air quality changed in U.S. cities since COVID lockdowns?

**Why it's interesting:** During lockdowns, pollution dropped. This project looks at what happened after.

**Data sources:** EPA Air Quality Data.

**Example article:** [NASA: Air Pollution Changes](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/air-pollution)

**Feedback:**
- Peer 1: Good visuals possible with this!
- Peer 2: Maybe focus on just 3 cities to keep it simple.
- Teacher: You can explore before vs after graphs for key pollutants.

## Final Thoughts

These questions are meant to help choose a data story that’s interesting, possible with public data, and useful for practicing data skills. I will pick one based on the feedback.
